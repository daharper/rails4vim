This repository contains a zip file with my .vim and .vimrc settings for
vim-rails development only on Ubuntu. The files are contained in the 
vimrails.zip. Uncompress this file to your home folder.

I have made a few minor customizations, such as ALT+ARROW_KEY to 
navigate windows.

Vim-rails is the work of Tim Pope, please see here for more information:
